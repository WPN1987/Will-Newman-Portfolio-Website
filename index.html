                <p class = "para">
                    At the start of 2019, I decided to make a career change away from retail after six years working night shifts. I wanted to challenge myself and learn 
                    new skills everyday, so I embarked on a journey to learn code via the Code Nation Master Course. I aspire to become a full-stack developer in the future 
                    through learning everyday and working on different projects. The reason I decided to enroll onto the Master Course at Code Nation was to learn how to code 
                    in an environment where I had support and advice, to help guide me through the learning process. The intensive nature of the course demands a steep learning 
                    curve, which I believe has helped improve me as a junior developer and I feel this has justified my decision to take the course as a route into the software 
                    development industry. 
                </p>
                <p class = "para">
                    During the Master Course at Code Nation I have gained skills in, Javascript, HTML, CSS and learning how to problem solve using charts, diagrams and psuedo 
                    code. I have also learnt skills in Node.js, introduction to testing using jest, React, using the terminal and command line, using git and git hub. I am 
                    looking to use the skills I have learnt to help develop my career by earning an apprenticeship so I can return to Code Nation and improve my knowledge and 
                    build my web tool box further. 
                </p>
                <p class = "para">
                    I have also attended Aberystwyth University, where I graduated with a Business and Management degree BSc (Econ) in 2011 and a Management and Marketing MSc
                    (Econ) degree in 2013.

                    My main interest is spending time with family, friends and going for walks with my partner. A big interest of mine is football, and I have spent the majority 
                    of my life playing and watching football, I support Manchester United FC and England. Although I have not played football in a while, I found playing a great 
                    way to stay fit and meet new people. I tend to spend more time enjoying the tactical analysis of football. I also lke watching films and series, such as the 
                    Marvel Cinematic Universe films, and I am massive fan of Game of Thrones. Other interests include gaming on my PS4 and listening to music.
